## Summary

City Distance Filter can be used to pick a center city and find all the cities listed in a map based on the distance entered by the user in the filter box. Hence, it filters the cities which are within the specified distance as entered by the user.

## Few Highlights

1. The project uses a library called Leaflet and React-Leaflet for maps and is made on React JS.
2. The pink marker shows the center and the locations are marked with blue marker.
3. Both the center object and locations array is hardcoded and you can change to check it.
4. There is a dynamic input box at the top of the page which reflects changes while inputting.
5. The project is responsive and is viewable on all mobile devices.

## Who Is This For?

1. Someone starting with React JS and want to make a map application.
2. Someone who want to use Latitude and Longitude in their map application and to find the distance between 2 places.
3. People who have worked on Leaflet in other frameworks or libraries and want to get a taste of React-Leaflet can start with this.
4. Someone who wants to make a full fledged app regarding cities in a country to travel or explore and wants to give filtering and other features can start over here.
5. Anybody trying their hands on some React JS and some map application.
6. Hope it helps. May the force with you!
